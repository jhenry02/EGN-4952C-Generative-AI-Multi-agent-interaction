# **OWL.TA**
OwlTA is an innovative educational platform that combines human expertise with AI to enhance teaching and learning. This platform leverages collaborative intelligence and multi-agent systems to generate personalized lesson plans, deliver content through Discord, and provide real-time student support. By seamlessly integrating these components, OwlTA creates a more engaging and effective learning experience for both teachers and students.

## **Technologies Used in Our Project:**
1.  **Discord.js**
  -  We use Discord.js to interact with Discordâ€™s API, enabling OwlTA to act as a teaching assistant within Discord channels. Discord.js allows us to build and manage bots that handle real-time communication with students and professors. It utilizes REST API protocols to fetch and send data, and WebSocket standards for maintaining live connections, which are critical for real-time interactions during classroom activities. The bot responds to commands like /createoutline or /save, assisting with lesson plan generation and student inquiries.

2. **TrussedAI**
 - TrussedAI is integrated into OwlTA to power AI-driven interactions, such as generating personalized lesson plans and assisting with content delivery. Although TrussedAI does not adhere to formal standards like GPT, it follows best practices in AI and natural language processing (NLP). TrussedAI processes user queries and delivers intelligent responses in real time, enhancing the AI's role as both a personal assistant to professors and a teaching assistant for students. Secure API communication, authentication, and encryption (using standards such as OAuth2) ensure the integrity and security of data exchange.

3. **Node.js**
 - OwlTA is built using Node.js, a runtime environment that allows us to write server-side code in JavaScript. Node.js is crucial for the platform's backend, handling requests, managing API calls, and maintaining the application's performance. Following the JavaScript standards defined by ECMA International (ECMAScript 6 and beyond), Node.js enables OwlTA to efficiently process commands and handle multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring smooth operation for both students and professors.

4. **SQLite3**
 - For managing and storing user data, OwlTA uses SQLite3 as its database engine. SQLite3 is a lightweight SQL database that allows us to store and retrieve user inputs efficiently. We use it to handle data related to lesson plans, student progress, and other interactions on the platform. By leveraging SQL, we can perform queries to insert, update, and retrieve data, ensuring that the platform can manage and track real-time changes in the classroom environment, such as saving outlines or processing student inquiries.
